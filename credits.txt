/*

A JavaScript Blackjack game created June 2013 by Chris Clower 
(clowerweb.com). Deck class loosely based on a tutorial at:
http://www.codecademy.com/courses/blackjack-part-1

All graphics and code were designed/written by me except for the
chip box on the table, which was taken from the image at:
http://www.marketwallpapers.com/wallpapers/9/wallpaper-52946.jpg

Uses Twitter Bootstrap and jQuery, which also were not created by
me :)

Fonts used:
* "Blackjack" logo: Exmouth
* Symbol/floral graphics: Dingleberries
* All other fonts: Adobe Garamond Pro

All graphics designed in Adobe Fireworks CS6

You are free to use or modify this code for any purpose, but I ask
that you leave this comment intact. Please understand that this is
still very much a work in progress, and is not feature complete nor
without bugs.

I will also try to comment the code better for future updates :D
